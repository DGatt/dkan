Structure
=========

As a Site Manager you handle the structures that other users operate within. This framework reflects the broader organizational priorities and brings greater visibility to the content on your Granicus Open Data site. Many of the tools that help organize the content on your Granicus Open Data site also make it easier to navigate and find the right content. All of this improves the experience of a site visitor and makes it more likely that citizens can use the data published on your site.

Site Navigation
---------------

Menus
~~~~~

Menus organize content and play a critical role in directing site visitors to the content they need. As Pages are added with new content, adding new menu links are the connectors for site visitors to your content. 

Some content (like Datasets or Data Stories) has a menu link in the main menu by default, but new Pages require a new link to navigate to the content. You can customize the default structure of the main menu as it makes sense for your site content.

Using menus
~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Admin Menu, hover over the menu link **Site Configuration**. From the drop-down list, select the **Menus** link to access the Menus page. 

The main menu is persistent, meaning that it appears on every page. This menu acts as an anchor for site visitors as they make their way through your site. Details like the order of menu links, link titles, and number of menu links can all impact how a site visitor interacts and engages with the content of your site. 

Click the **list links** button to view and manage all the links on the main menu. 

As a Site Manager, you can manage the details from the main menu page in the following ways: Add a new link, Order menu links, Enable and disable links, and Edit or delete a menu link.

Add a new link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Granicus Open Data comes with preset menu links. These links point to pages that automatically collect content as it’s published, like Datasets and Data Stories. 

For new Pages with new content, create a link and add it to the main menu by clicking the **Add link** button at the top-left of the page. Complete all the fields in the form and click the Save button at the bottom of the page. 

Menu link title
  The title is what the site visitor sees as they navigate with the main menu.
Path
  The menu link must point to content, so that when a site visitor clicks the link they are appropriately directed. Paste in the URL for the link. 
Description
  The description essentially acts like alt-text. Make sure you include a description, but keep it brief. 
Enabled checkbox
  By default, when you create a new link, it’s also enabled. Only enabled links appear on the main menu. Uncheck this box if the link should not appear on the main menu.
Show as expanded
  This option only applies to menu links with child menu items. When this box is checked all the child items are displayed.
Parent link
  By default, the parent link is the main menu. Links with this parent link will appear on the top-level menu bar. Click the Parent link drop-down menu and select the correct parent. 
Weight
  Weight determines the order of menu links. High numbers (heavier) are lower on the menu, and smaller numbers (lighter) appear near or at the top of the menu.

Order menu links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change the order of how links appear on the main menu with the simple drag-and-drop interface. Click and hold the cross icon to drag a menu link into a new order. 

If an asterisk appears next to the title of a menu link it indicates that the menu link has been altered, but changes will not be made until saved. 

**Note:** You can also use the drag-and-drop interface to nest or un-nest menu links. 

To nest a link (make a link a child of another menu link), click and hold the cross icon and drag the menu link under and to the right of the new parent menu link. 

To un-nest a link (make a child link a top-level link on the main menu), click and hold the cross icon and drag it above the previous parent link. 

Click the **Save Configuration** button at the bottom of the page to finalize your changes.

Enable and disable links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of deleting a menu link to remove it from the main menu, you can enable and disable menu links. Disabled links remain in the list for you to edit and manage, but site visitors won’t see them on the main menu. 

To disable a menu link, uncheck the box in the **Enabled** column in the row of the menu link you want to disable.

Edit or delete links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change the details of a menu link by clicking the **Edit** link in the Operations column in the row of the menu link you want to edit. When editing a menu link you can change details like the title, the path (URL), and parent link. 

Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page to finalize the changes. 

Deleting a menu link is a permanent action and cannot be undone. If you delete a link and want to add it back, you’ll have to create it as a new menu link. Disabling a link is recommended before fully deleting a menu link. 

To delete a link, click the **Delete** link in the Operations column in the row of the menu link you want to delete.

Adding and editing Topics, Tags, and data formats
-------------------------------------------------

Topics
~~~~~~

Enhanced user experience, branding, and information architecting–the Topics feature touches on all of these areas to add ease-of-use for both site visitors and users working behind the scenes.

With so much data in a single place, Granicus Open Data sites have a number of tools to organize the information for citizens to easily and intuitively find what they are looking for. Topics catch site visitors’ attention right from the Home page. As with most Granicus Open Data features, Topics are built to provide a crisp, engaging user experience that is adaptable for customization. Either font icons or images can be used, and these graphics can be customized in appearance and color to fit the individual look and feel of any agency. The default Granicus Open Data icon font set includes over 100 icons, and new icon font sets can be added anytime for a broad range of options.

Topics typically reflect broad categories like transportation or education. These are areas of interest that should remain consistent themselves and collect timely, relevant content. Topics appear on the front page (unless otherwise modified) along with their assigned icons.

Where Topics are managed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topics are included in the Structure section of this guide because they're considered a taxonomy. Taxonomies are a high-level way of collecting and organizing information. The smaller pieces of information that make up taxonomies are called terms. So for example, you could have a taxonomy of fruit and individual terms might be "apple" or "banana".

You'll find Topics in the **Taxonomy** drop-down menu item under the **Site Configuration** menu link on the Admin Menu.

   Click on the **Topics** link to get to the main page where Topics are managed.
   
 Adding and managing terms
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Granicus Open Data comes with six preset Topics: Transportation, Education, Finance and Budgeting, Health Care, Public Safety, and City Planning. You can add to the existing terms or replace them with different terms. The Topics for your Granicus Open Data site depend largely on the data on the site and the areas of interest you believe your site visitors are most interested in.  

Add a term
  On the Topics page, click on the Add term button to open the options for adding a new term (a single Topic) to be included in the collection of Topics. The only fields that are important for adding a new Topic are the Title field and icon selection. The title is the name of your Topic that will appear on the front page of your Granicus Open Data site under the icon you select.

Icon Type: Font
+++++++++++++++

Icon
  Choose an icon from your font icon library. Whichever you choose, you want something the is both eye-catching and expressive. Site visitors should know exactly what kind of content the Topic includes from the graphic without relying on the text.
Icon Color
  For font icons, you can choose a color for the icon of your Topic. Images do not have an option to change the color. It’s best to choose a single color that all your icons have in common. The color should also fit the look and feel of the rest of your site, either as a matching or complementary color.

   :alt: font icon options

Icon Type: Image

If you have an image that you prefer to use for the Topic icon, select the Image selection instead of font icon. Click the **Choose File** button to find the image on your computer and then click the Upload button to finalize the selection.

**Note:** there are limits on the file size and type.

   In this example, the Site Manager is adding a new term to the Topics taxonomy called "Environment". The Site Manager chooses an icon from the library and then chooses a color for the icon. Once the Topic is saved it will appear on the front page.

When all your selections are made, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page to finalize your choices and save the term. Once the new Topic is saved it will appear on the front page with all the other Topics.

It's best to keep your site looking orderly, so you don't want Topics to appear like they do in the image below. For the purposes of this example, a different color was chosen to demonstrate the change, but in practice color schemes should remain consistent across your site.

Additionally, the number of Topics pushes down to a second line and appears uneven. Keep the number of Topics even appearance by maintaining a certain number of Topics at any given time. Since there are six Topics to a line, that means the number of Topics should follow a factor of six.
