Managing Existing Content
=========================

In smaller organizations, Site Managers may both be writing and editing their own content to then directly publish the content to the live site. Larger organizations may have people in other roles like Editors and Content Creators to help with handling a large mass of content on the site. Depending on the scale of your organization and volume of content, you may spend more or less time directly handling content. Learn more about user roles in the :ref:`People<user-docs people` section of this guide. 

Where do I edit existing content?
---------------------------------

Site Managers can edit any content on the site, either from the main Content page or directly on the piece of content itself.  

Editing from the Content menu 
-----------------------------

The main Content page is the most comprehensive place to find and access content to edit an individual piece. Though the menu is comprehensive, editing the details of a piece of content can only happen one at a time. From the Admin Menu, click on the **Content** link to access all the content that exists on the site.

As the Site Manager, you have access to create all content types possible as well as edit, unpublish, and delete all existing content regardless of who the author is. You can create new content from this page as well as manage all the existing content and files on your Granicus Open Data site from here. Files include things like images, videos, font files for icons, other graphics, etc.  

In any scenario, as a Site Manager you can use this page to look at the content on the site to see who created a particular piece of content, when it was last updated, its status (published or unpublished) and take action on existing content.
